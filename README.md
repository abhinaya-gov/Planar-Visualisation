# Planar-Visualisation
This project implements shallow and deep neural networks from scratch using NumPy to classify a non-linearly separable planar dataset. It focuses on understanding how depth affects representation learning by explicitly implementing forward propagation, backpropagation, and gradient descent without high-level ML frameworks.
